# Kuhn

Hugo now also meets CSS Grid. This theme was originally designed and developed by [Morten Rand-Hendriksen](https://mor10.com) as a WordPress theme. Kuhn is hyper-opinionated and developed to take advantage of modern CSS. It was developed for mor10.com and is released as a showcase of what CSS Grid can do within theme layouts.

Practically all unnecessary elements stripped out from the original WordPress theme except for the css, which is basically the same. Ideal for use as a blog.
